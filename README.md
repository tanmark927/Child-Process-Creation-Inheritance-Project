# Child-Process-Creation-Inheritance-Project
This is a string replacement program that finds a word within a string and replaces it with another word. It also keeps a count on the number of times the desired word is replaced. The replacement procedure involves the creation of a child process, and a child will be made for each replacement scenario. If a replacement fails, the child process will do the replacement in an infinite loop meaning that the child can only be terminated using the kill command. To exit the program, type in “!wq” as one of your strings to find and replace.
